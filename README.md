# Full Stack Web Development with Python, Django & React

This repository showcases a **Full Stack Web Development** project that integrates **Python**, **Django**, and **React** to build a modern, interactive web application. The application follows the **REST API** architecture, leveraging **Django REST Framework (DRF)** for backend development and **React** for the frontend, creating a scalable and efficient solution. The project features user authentication, an interactive UI, and API integration between the frontend and backend.

##  Key Technologies

### Backend:
- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
- **Django REST Framework (DRF)**: A powerful toolkit for building Web APIs with Django, enabling seamless integration with the frontend.

### Frontend:
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, allowing the creation of interactive and dynamic web applications.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps, used for managing the application state in a scalable way.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for creating responsive, customizable, and modern UI designs.

### Database:
- **PostgreSQL / SQLite**: Relational databases for persistent storage of application data.

### Authentication:
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Provides secure and scalable authentication and authorization for users.

### Deployment:
- **Docker**: Containerizes the application to ensure consistency across different environments.
- **Heroku / Vercel**: Cloud platforms for deployment of the backend and frontend.

##  Features

- **User Authentication & Authorization**: Implemented JWT-based authentication for secure user login and registration.
- **RESTful API**: Built using Django REST Framework, providing robust and flexible API endpoints for the frontend to interact with.
- **Modern UI**: Developed with React and styled using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a responsive and seamless user experience.
- **State Management**: Uses Redux to manage the applicationâ€™s state and ensure smooth interactions between components.
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL or SQLite for structured data storage, with Django models for ORM-based management.
- **API Integration**: Connects the frontend to the backend through well-defined RESTful API calls.
